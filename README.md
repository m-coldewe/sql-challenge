# Project Title

## Overview

A research project looking at the people Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company) employed during the 1980s and 1990s, using information stored in CSV files that was imported to an SQL database. Utilizes ProsgreSQL.

## Purpose

- examined the data provided in the csv files
- used quickDB to create a table schema for each of the csv files with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints specified
- imported files to the corresponding SQL table
- queried the imported data to generate the following:
	1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
	2. List the first name, last name and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
	3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
	4. List the department number for each employee along with that employee's employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
	5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
	6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
	7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
	8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names.


I received assistance on this assignment from Tutor Geronimo. He told me a clearer way to write the queries, which I kept for both versions of the query document as leaving them in a single line proved too confusing for me. He also recommended utiliing "using" for the joins, as it was a simpler and clearer method, with the caveat that it would not always work. He explained that while "using" was simpler, "on" was more reliable. To ensure I understood, after our session, I completed the queries again using "on." Both query documents are included.
